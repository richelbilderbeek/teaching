## Teaching style

-   Literate [1]
-   Evidence-based, e.g. [Bell, 2020][Hattie, 2012][Hattie, 2023][Schwartz, 2012]
-   Active learning
-   Learning community
-   Well-prepared [1]
-   Student-centered
-   Transparent [1]

## Features

-   Every learner needs to be active
-   Follows the pace of learners that need more time
-   Fast learners learn by helping
-   Asks learners randomly [Bell, 2020]
-   Dare to try out new things (and fail in plain sight) [Bell, 2020]

## Lecturing

I only do this for unimportant topics, 
as lecturing hinders learning [2].

Hence, this was the only lecture in the course :-)

(I **do** need to tell about myself [Schwartz, 2012])
