Media computation, group work and CS0 have the highest average pass rate:

![Vihavainen et al., 2014, figure 2](vihavainen_et_al_2014_fig_2.png)

> Table 2 from `[Vihavainen et al., 2014]`: 
> 'Ten most common intervention tags and
> the overall intervention effects of the studies in
> which they appeared in. 
> Number of studies including the intervention denoted as n,
> realized pass rates reported using minimum, maximum, median, 
> average and standard deviation (σ) in percentages'.

Here are the definitions given in that paper:

- 'CS0 : the creation of a preliminary course that was to
  be taken before the introductory programming course;
  could be organized only for e.g. at-risk students
- 'group work : activities with increased group work
  commitment such as team-based learning and cooperative
  learning'
- 'media computation: activities explicitly declaring the
  use of media computation (e.g. the book)'. The paper elaborates with: 
  'each article that was coded with the tag media computation, tags content:
  media, contextualization, context: media, were added to de-
  scribe that the content (material) of the course was updated
  to contain media-type content, the course was contextual-
  ized so that the content had more meaning to the students
  that participated in the course, and finally, that the context
  revolved around media'

The study `[Medeiros et al., 2018]` tries to do a review on teaching
programming, with a big heterogeneity in how experiments are performed.
A main finding is:

> The most frequently cited skills necessary for
> learning programming were related to problem solving and mathematical ability. 
> Problem solving was also cited as a learning
> challenge, followed by motivation and engagement, 
> and difficulties in learning the syntax of programming languages

Note the motivation and -especially- engagement:
this will be lacking in a monologue.
