## Teaching

- 2007-2008 MSc: Teaching in Pre-higher education in Biology
- Oct 2008-Aug 2010: 0.6 FTE teacher and team leader, 12-18 yo
- Jan 2014-Jan 2021: coordinator of multiple courses, as volunteer, 8-18 yo
- Sep 2019-Mar 2024: team leader of programming team, 13-38 yo
- Sep 2022-now: coordinator of multiple courses, as volunteer, 8-88 yo
- Mar 2023-now: teacher at UPPMAX, 18-88 yo

## Teaching style

- Literate `[1]`
- Evidence-based,
  e.g. `[Bell, 2020][Hattie, 2012][Hattie, 2023][Schwartz, 2012]`
- Active learning
- Learning community
- Well-prepared `[1]`
- Student-centered
- Transparent `[1]`

## Features

- Every learner needs to be active
- Follows the pace of learners that need more time
- Fast learners learn by helping
- Asks learners randomly, as he should `[Bell, 2020][Eddy et al, 2015]`
    - Some really like it `[3]`
    - Some really don't `[4]`
- Dare to try out new things (and fail in plain sight) `[Bell, 2020]`

## Lecturing

I only do this for unimportant topics,
as lecturing hinders learning `[2]`.

Hence, this was the only lecture in the course :-)

(I **do** need to tell about myself `[Schwartz, 2012]`)
