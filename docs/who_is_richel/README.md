## Teaching style

Style             |Example of how this looks like
------------------|--------------------------------------
Literate          |Follows a formal teaching cycle
Evidence-based    |Does 'cold calling'
Active learning   |Short lectures
Learner-centered  |Follows the pace of the learners
Learning community|Fast learners learn by helping
Well-prepared     |Lesson plans, answers, videos
Transparent       |Publishing evaluations and reflections

???- question "What is a teaching cycle?"

    It is a formalized form of teaching that combines all evidence-based
    best practices in a workflow. My favorite teaching cycle:

    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD
      prior_knowledge[Prior knowledge]
      present[Present]
      challenge[Challenge]
      feedback[Feedback]
      repeat[Repeat]
      prior_knowledge --> present
      present --> challenge
      challenge --> feedback
      feedback --> repeat
      repeat --> prior_knowledge
    ```

    > Evidence-based teaching cycle, from `[Bell, 2020]`

???- question "What is 'cold calling'?"

    Cold calling is, after asking a plenary question and giving
    all learners time to think, to as a random learner for the answer.

    The goal of this is to get an idea of the full classroom's knowledge.

???- question "Why do 'cold calling'?"

    Because it ensures the whole class is active (and not just the ones
    that are used to raising their hands) `[Bell, 2020][Eddy et al, 2015]`.

    Some learners really like it `[3]` and some really don't `[4]`.

???- question "Why are lectures short?"

    Because lecturing **hinders** learning `[2]`.

???- question "Why do you tell about yourself?"

    Because I should  `[Schwartz, 2012]`.
