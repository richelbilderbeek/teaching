# Peer observations

I think peer observations are a useful learning experiences
to get better at teaching.

My favorite peer observation model is the 'peer review model' `[Gosling, 2002]`,
that has the goal 'engagement in discussion about teaching; self and mutual
reflection'. Here are the characteristics:

Who does it & to whom?               | teachers observe each other
Purpose                              | Analysis, discussion, wider experience of teaching methods
Outcome                              | Non-judgemental, constructive feedback
Status of evidence                   | peer shared perception
Relationship of observer to observed | equality/mutuality
Confidentiality                      | Between observer and the observed - shared within learning set
Inclusion                            | all
Judgement                            | Non-judgemental, constructive feedback
What is observed?                    | Teaching performance, class, learning materials
Who benefits?                        | Mutual between peers
Conditions for success               | Teaching is valued, discussed
Risks                                | Complacency, conservatism, unfocused

My favorite way to do peer observation is based on the tips from
`[Siddiqui et al., 2007]`, with the most important practical
one is to **schedule a session before and after the observation
to discuss, for a duration of 45 minutes each**.

## Peer observations overview

## Peer observation minor literature review

The goal is to find out how to best do peer observation of teaching.
I searched [Google Scholar for 'peer observation of teaching'](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=peer+observation+of+teaching&oq=peer+observation)
and go through the first 10 hits.

Then I rate the usefulness of a paper based on its title:

Starting from the two most useful papers:

`[Siddiqui et al., 2007]` has these tips:

- Tip 1:  Choose the observer carefully.
  I think I do so.
- Tip 2:  Set aside time for the peer observation.
  That is, for each of the three stages (pre-observation, the observation
  itself and the post-observation) schedule 45 minutes at minimum
- Tip 3: Clarify expectations.
    - My general expectation: to discuss teaching respectfully with the observed
    lesson as the subject (i.e. tip 12)
    - When observed, I expect the observer not to interfere with my teaching (i.e. tip 9)
    - When observing, I expect the teacher to have thought of how to deal with
    my presence (e.g. where do I sit, how to include the students (i.e. tip 6))
- Tip 4: Familiarise yourself with the course
- Tip 5: Select the instrument wisely
- Tip 6: Include students.
- Tip 7: Be objective
- Tip 8: Resist the urge to compare with your own teaching style
- Tip 9: Do not intervene
- Tip 10: Follow the general principles for feedback
- Tip 11: Respect confidentiality.
  Here I should be clear what I put online and what not:
    - When I am observed, I enjoy to upload it as-is
    - When I am observing, I leave it to the observee what to do with my notes
- Tip 12: Make it a learning experience

`[Gosling, 2002]` states that there are three main observation models:

- evaluation model
- development model
- peer review model

The most relevant here is the 'peer review model', as its
purpose is 'engagement in discussion about teaching; self and mutual reflection'

I think this is good enough for now,
with `[Siddiqui et al., 2007]`
being a perfect starting point.
