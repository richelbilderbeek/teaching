# Reflection

- Date: 2026-01-22
- RSE Tools, 'GitHub Actions'

Already before the talk, I was disturbed:
my pull request to the main repository had feedback.
I did not ask for feedback. I disagreed with the feedback.
I felt sorry for the person that was maybe asked to give feedback.
It was a sad situation. Apparently, the group has a procedure to
merge pull requests after the talk. This would (I would realize during
the talk) that there was no link to the exercises I could share.

Even though I think my talk was good enough and I adapted well enough,
I was not happy with it, as I had higher expectations.
Or: I did not fulfill my goals:

- [Unsure] Understand what GitHub Actions is
- [Unsure] Understand why GitHub Actions are important
- [No] Practice to use GitHub Actions

My expectation was:

- Interactive,
  i.e. be able to talk to most of my colleagues 1-on-1
- Active teaching,
  i.e. let the audience actually find out what it is
- Many questions in small groups,
  i.e. no 1 person asking questions in big groups.
  I do this commonly in breakout rooms

The reality was:

- Reasonably interactive: even though there was a recording (I was
  against this), there were still around 8 colleagues (out of around 20)
  willing to interact.
- Passive learning: because my pull request was not accepted, as per
  RSE Tools routines, my exercises were not live on the website.
  I did not see that coming. It meant I had to do the exercises
  myself. I hated that.
- Few people asking questions in a big group

## Evaluation results

I am happy that there is 1 evaluation response:

> Very nice talk, you clearly know how to teach stuff. Can you share the link to the exercise?

Thanks!
