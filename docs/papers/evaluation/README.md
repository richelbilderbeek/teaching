# No need to bother students to fill in course evaluations

For decades, universities have been asking their students about their
experiences with their courses, with the goal of improving the quality
of the courses. However, it is mostly misconceptions instead of real
successes.

## Survey questions

### Survey question: What is your overall rating for the course?

A critical meta-analyses concluded that there is no relationship
between the students' responses and any metric related to course
quality, as it is mostly small studies in pedagogy with low rigor
that happen to find a relation [Clayson, 2009].

This question is used in many course evaluations, such as the European
bioinformatics training center called ELIXIR [Gurwitz et al., 2020].

### Survey question: How satisfied are you with the course?

A critical meta-analyses concluded that there is no relationship
between the students' responses and any metric related to course
quality, as it is mostly small studies in pedagogy with low rigor
that happen to find a relation [Uttl et al., 2017].

### Survey question: How confident are you in the learning outcomes?

Even student self-assessment in achieving the courses' learning
outcomes have no relation with actual test performance [Liaw et al., 2012].
This is a study on 33 learners.

### Survey question: Would you recommend this course?

`[Ang et al., 2018]` did a study, on 113 learners,
that concluded that having a positive response
to this question is mostly determined by the joy of learning
in the course. This joy of learning is most strongly determined
by tutors, **not** by the teacher.

The remaining determinant for a positive response
is the perceived value of the course,
which itself is mostly determined by the course bridging
theory and real-world practice.

This survey question hence mostly
measures the quality of the tutor(s) and to a lesser extent
the estimated benefit a course provides to the learner.
The study found that measuring its 7 determinants
predicts the answer to this survey question in around half of all cases.
