# No need to bother students to fill in course evaluations


For decades, universities have been asking their students about their
experiences with their courses, with the goal of improving the quality
of the courses. However, it is mostly misconceptions instead of real
successes. For example, the question 'What is your overall rating for the
course?' is used in many course evaluations, such as the European
bioinformatics training center called ELIXIR [Gurwitz et al., 2020].



### Survey question: What is your overall rating for the course?

A critical meta-analyses concluded that there is no relationship
between the students' responses and any metric related to course
quality, as it is mostly small studies in pedagogy with low rigor
that happen to find a relation [Clayson, 2009]. 

### Survey question: How satisfied are you with the course?

A critical meta-analyses concluded that there is no relationship
between the students' responses and any metric related to course
quality, as it is mostly small studies in pedagogy with low rigor
that happen to find a relation [Uttl et al., 2017].

### Survey question: How confident are you in the learning outcomes?

Even student self-assessment in achieving the courses' learning
outcomes have no relation with actual test performance [Liaw et al., 2012].
This is a study on 33 learners.

### Survey question: Would you recommend this course?

Searching the literature
for 'using course recommendation in evaluation'
(and sentences alike) resulted in one relevant hit.
This paper, `[Ang et al., 2018]`, shows that using
this question may indeed be a valid way to asses course
quality `[Ang et al., 2018]`.
This is a study on 113 learners.
