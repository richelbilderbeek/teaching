# Counts

Goal of this experiment is to investigate the combined effect of
lecturing quality and interactivity.

## Rubrics

Although using rubrics, it is hard to assess the value objectively.

### lecturing quality

- Variable `a`: How to deal with slides:
  - Reading text/slides literally: 1
  - Discussing text/slides: 6
  - Letting learners read: 10
- Variable `b`: Structure of the contet
  - Chaotic, no structure: 1
  - Structured is assumed to be there, yet hard to find: 4
  - Structured is reasonable, yet unexplained order: 7
  - Structure follows up logically: 10

### Interactivity

- Variable `c`: 'dialogueness':
  - 1: monologue
  - 10: dialogue
- Variable `d`: questions
  - 1: never ask questions
  - 4: ask for reponse and not getting/demanding it 
  - 10: ask for reponse and getting/demanding it 

Grade is: `(c + d) / 2`
