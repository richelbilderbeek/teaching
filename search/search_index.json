See figure 4 for the exact differences.</p> <p>There is already an effect of learners showing up on time when a course is announced to require cameras, as can be shown for the 9:00-9:30 data points in figure 3.</p>"},{"location":"data/counts/#discussion","title":"Discussion","text":"<p>There is no investigation of the mechanism that causes learners to leave a course earlier.</p> <p>In the methods, it was chosen to apply one LOESS fit as a reasonable running average. It may be argued that there should be two LOESS fits applied to the data: one before and one after lunch. However, as the reasoning of such as argument has been unconvincing to the author so far, these are not included as a main result. These figure, figures A1-A3, however, can be found in the appendix.</p> <p>An unexpected finding is that more learners show up on time when a course is announced to require cameras. This could encourage both course leaders and teachers to announce the use of cameras in course announcements.</p> <p>The study design can definitely be improved. In the acquired dataset, each course iteration is sometimes given by one teacher, where sometimes there are as much as four teachers during a day. In an ideal study design, a course is given by one teacher twice: once with cameras encouraged to be on, and once with cameras off. This study chose to obtain data as unobtrusively as possible, with the hope of sketching a baseline expectation for further research.</p> <p>Additionally, there may be possible correlation between teachers that encourage learners to turn on their cameras and the courses they pick to teach. In an ideal study design, a course is given by multiple teachers twice. Again, the aim of this study was to sketch a baseline expectation for further research.</p> <p>Additionally, the observations were done at irregular intervals, (as is shown in figure A4), which is, when the number of learners change.</p> <p>Given the big amount of learners lost during a day, with already 25% of all learners having left at lunch, course coordinators could consider to ask teachers to report the number of learners after lunch too. Although this research makes no claim about any mechanism for learners leaving early, reporting this number will make teachers aware of a low or high dropout rate during their teaching. Having a low dropout rate should not be use as a perverse incentive (i.e. there should be no effects on career), but may inspire a teacher to (re)think his/her practice.</p> <p>Given the big difference in learners remaining in the course, for having a camera on or off, teachers may feel more encouraged to ask their learners to turn on their cameras.</p>"},{"location":"data/counts/#appendix","title":"Appendix","text":""},{"location":"data/counts/#a1-file-overview","title":"A1.

One question that appears commonly in such anonymous feedback form is to let the learner rate the course and/or give his/her satisfaction of the course. There are plenty of small studies that find a relation between these scores and course quality indicator. However, meta analyses <code>[Clayson, 2009][Uttl et al., 2017]</code> reveal that this relation is most likely to be found in (1) small studies, (2) studies in the field of pedagogy, (3) low methodological rigor. Or in other words: this relation vanishes when the studies get bigger and have stronger defined metrics. One of these two meta analyses (<code>[Clayson, 2009]</code>) helps understand why we may have the misconception that there is a relation between course satisfaction and course quality: humans are quite capable to always 'explain' a low or high course satisfaction in hindsight.</p> <p>Even though asking learners to rate a course is useless, managers and/or funders insist on asking so anyways. One reason to do so, is to continue a timeline of data collection, such as is done by the Europe-wide bioinformatics training organisation ELIXIR, reporting course quality indicators in their Training Metrics Database since 2009. Another example is the National Academic Infrastructure for Super\u00adcomputing in Sweden ('NAISS'), which insists on asking learners to grade a course after having attended one.</p> <p>Both centers, however, help alleviate the problem by letting teachers add their own course evaluation questions.</p> <p>One addition to these question can be to let learners rate their confidence in each of the objectives.</p> <p>Students that report their progress to be good do have higher grades <code>[Benton et al., 2013]</code>.</p> Numbers in that study? <p>Numbers from <code>[Benton et al., 2013]</code>:</p> <ul> <li>188 learners</li> <li>5 different exams</li> <li>4 out of 5 exams show a significant correlation</li> <li>Pearson correlation coefficient: around 0.5.</li> <li>Slope is around 0.4 grade (scale 0 to 5)   increase per level of confidence (scale 1 to 5).</li> </ul> <p>Also <code>[Sundstr\u00f6m, 2011]</code> concludes that self-reported skills have a correlation with actual skills.</p> Numbers in that study? <p>Numbers from <code>[Sundstr\u00f6m, 2011]</code>:</p> <ul> <li>136 learners</li> <li>Two self-assessment measures</li> <li>Pearson correlation coefficient for Perceived Practical Driver Competence   (PPDC): around 0.7.</li> <li>Pearson correlation coefficient for Self-Assessment of Driving Skills   (SADS): around 0.7.</li> <li>Slope is unreported</li> </ul> <p>A big meta-analysis <code>[Sitzmann et al., 2010]</code>, however, finds that there is no correlation between self-reported increases in knowledge and knowledge gains.</p> Numbers in that study? <p>Numbers from <code>[Sitzmann et al., 2010]</code></p> <ul> <li>166 studies</li> <li>41,237 learners</li> </ul> <p>An open question is if asking learners to report their progress may be a useful mean to assess course quality.

I think I do so.</li> <li>Tip 2:  Set aside time for the peer observation.   That is, for each of the three stages (pre-observation, the observation   itself and the post-observation) schedule 45 minutes at minimum</li> <li>Tip 3: Clarify expectations.<ul> <li>My general expectation: to discuss teaching respectfully with the observed lesson as the subject (i.e. tip 12)</li> <li>When observed, I expect the observer not to interfere with my teaching (i.e. tip 9)</li> <li>When observing, I expect the teacher to have thought of how to deal with my presence (e.g. where do I sit, how to include the students (i.e. tip 6))</li> </ul> </li> <li>Tip 4: Familiarise yourself with the course</li> <li>Tip 5: Select the instrument wisely</li> <li>Tip 6: Include students.</li> <li>Tip 7: Be objective</li> <li>Tip 8: Resist the urge to compare with your own teaching style</li> <li>Tip 9: Do not intervene</li> <li>Tip 10: Follow the general principles for feedback</li> <li>Tip 11: Respect confidentiality.   Here I should be clear what I put online and what not:<ul> <li>When I am observed, I enjoy to upload it as-is</li> <li>When I am observing, I leave it to the observee what to do with my notes</li> </ul> </li> <li>Tip 12: Make it a learning experience</li> </ul> <p><code>[Gosling, 2002]</code> states that there are three main observation models:</p> <ul> <li>evaluation model</li> <li>development model</li> <li>peer review model</li> </ul> <p>The most relevant here is the 'peer review model', as its purpose is 'engagement in discussion about teaching; self and mutual reflection'</p> What is the full table?
