At 10:30, the highest amount of learners during the day are present, after which this number decreases.

See figure 4 for the exact differences.</p> <p>There is already an effect of learners showing up on time when a course is announced to require cameras, as can be shown for the 9:00-9:30 data points in figure 3.</p>"},{"location":"data/counts/#discussion","title":"Discussion","text":"<p>There is no investigation of the mechanism that causes learners to leave a course earlier.</p> <p>In the methods, it was chosen to apply one LOESS fit as a reasonable running average. It may be argued that there should be two LOESS fits applied to the data: one before and one after lunch. However, as the reasoning of such as argument has been unconvincing to the author so far, these are not included as a main result. These figure, figures A1-A3, however, can be found in the appendix.</p> <p>An unexpected finding is that more learners show up on time when a course is announced to require cameras. This could encourage both course leaders and teachers to announce the use of cameras in course announcements.</p> <p>The study design can definitely be improved. In the acquired dataset, each course iteration is sometimes given by one teacher, where sometimes there are as much as four teachers during a day. In an ideal study design, a course is given by one teacher twice: once with cameras encouraged to be on, and once with cameras off. This study chose to obtain data as unobtrusively as possible, with the hope of sketching a baseline expectation for further research.</p> <p>Additionally, there may be possible correlation between teachers that encourage learners to turn on their cameras and the courses they pick to teach. In an ideal study design, a course is given by multiple teachers twice. Again, the aim of this study was to sketch a baseline expectation for further research.</p> <p>Additionally, the observations were done at irregular intervals, (as is shown in figure A4), which is, when the number of learners change.</p> <p>Given the big amount of learners lost during a day, with already 25% of all learners having left at lunch, course coordinators could consider to ask teachers to report the number of learners after lunch too. Although this research makes no claim about any mechanism for learners leaving early, reporting this number will make teachers aware of a low or high dropout rate during their teaching. Having a low dropout rate should not be use as a perverse incentive (i.e. there should be no effects on career), but may inspire a teacher to (re)think his/her practice.</p> <p>Given the big difference in learners remaining in the course, for having a camera on or off, teachers may feel more encouraged to ask their learners to turn on their cameras.</p>"},{"location":"data/counts/#appendix","title":"Appendix","text":""},{"location":"data/counts/#a1-file-overview","title":"A1.
